Randomized Benchmarking
=======================

Randomization benchmarking (RB) is a well-known technique to measure average gate performance
by running sequences of random Clifford gates that should return the qubits to the initial state.
Qiskit Ignis has tools to generate one- and two-qubit gate Clifford RB sequences simultaneously,
as well as performing interleaved RB, purity RB and RB on the non-Clifford CNOT-Dihedral group.
