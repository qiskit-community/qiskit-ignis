def lstsq_fit(data, basis_matrix, weights=None, PSD=True, trace=None):
    """
    Reconstruct a density matrix using MLE least-squares fitting.

    Args:
        data (vector like): vector of expectation values
        basis_matrix (matrix like): matrix of measurement operators
        weights (vector like, optional): vector of weights to apply to the
                                         objective function (default: None)
        PSD (bool, optional): Enforced the fitted matrix to be positive
                              semidefinite (default: True)
        trace (int, optional): trace constraint for the fitted matrix
                               (default: None).

    Returns:
        The fitted matrix rho that minimizes
        ||basis_matrix * vec(rho) - data||_2.

    Additional Information:

        Objective function
        ------------------
        This fitter solves the least-squares minimization:

            minimize ||a * x - b ||_2

        where:
            a is the matrix of measurement operators a[i] = vec(M_i).H
            b is the vector of expectation value data for each projector
              b[i] ~ Tr[M_i.H * x] = (a * x)[i]
            x is the vectorized density matrix (or Choi-matrix) to be fitted

        PSD Constraint
        --------------
        Since this minimization problem is unconstrained the returned fitted
        matrix may not be postive semidefinite (PSD). To enforce the PSD
        constraint the fitted matrix is rescaled using the method proposed in
        Reference [1].

        Trace constraint
        ----------------
        In general the trace of the fitted matrix will be determined by the
        input data. If a trace constraint is specified the fitted matrix
        will be rescaled to have this trace by:
            rho = trace * rho / trace(rho)
