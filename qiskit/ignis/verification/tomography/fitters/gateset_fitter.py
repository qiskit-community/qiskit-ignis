        Additional information:
            The fitter attempts to output a GST result from the collected
            experimental data. The output will be a dictionary of the computed
            operators for the gates, as well as the measurment operator and
            initial state of the system.

            The input for the fitter consists of the experimental data
            collected by the backend, the circuits on which it operated
            and the gateset basis used when collecting the data.

        Additional Information:
            Given a gate set (G1,...,Gm)
            and SPAM circuits (F1,...,Fn) constructed from those gates
            the data should contain the probabilities of the following types:
            p_ijk = E*F_i*G_k*F_j*rho
            p_ij = E*F_i*F_j*rho

            We have p_ijk = self.probs[(Fj, Gk, Fi)] since in self.probs
            (Fj, Gk, Fi) indicates first applying Fj, then Gk, then Fi.

            One constructs the Gram matrix g = (p_ij)_ij
            which can be described as a product g=AB
            where A = sum (i> <E F_i) and B=sum (F_j rho><j)
            For each gate Gk one can also construct the matrix Mk=(pijk)_ij
            which can be described as Mk=A*Gk*B
            Inverting g we obtain g^-1 = B^-1A^-1 and so
            g^1 * Mk = B^-1 * Gk * B
            This gives us a matrix similiar to Gk's representing matrix.
            However, it will not be the same as Gk,
            since the observable results cannot distinguish
            between (G1,...,Gm) and (B^-1*G1*B,...,B^-1*Gm*B)
            a further step of *Gauge optimization* is required on the results
            of the linear inversion stage.
            One can also use the linear inversion results as a starting point
            for a MLE optimization for finding a physical gateset, since
            unless the probabilities are accurate, the resulting gateset
            need not be physical.
