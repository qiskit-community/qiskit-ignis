        r"""Reconstruct a quantum channel using CVXPY convex optimization.

        **Choi matrix**

        The Choi matrix object is a QuantumChannel representation which
        may be converted to other representations using the classes
        `SuperOp`, `Kraus`, `Stinespring`, `PTM`, `Chi` from the module
        `qiskit.quantum_info.operators`. The raw matrix data for the
        representation may be obtained by `channel.data`.

        **Fitter method**

        The ``cvx`` fitter method used CVXPY convex optimization package.
        The ``lstsq`` method uses least-squares fitting (linear inversion).
        The ``auto`` method will use ``cvx`` if the CVXPY package is found on
        the system, otherwise it will default to ``lstsq``.

        **Objective function**

        This fitter solves the constrained least-squares
        minimization: :math:`minimize: ||a * x - b ||_2`

        subject to:

         * :math:`x >> 0` (PSD)
         * :math:`\text{trace}(x) = dim` (trace)
         * :math:`\text{partial_trace}(x) = \text{identity}` (trace_preserving)

        where:

         * a is the matrix of measurement operators
           :math:`a[i] = \text{vec}(M_i).H`
         * b is the vector of expectation value data for each projector
           :math:`b[i] ~ \text{Tr}[M_i.H * x] = (a * x)[i]`
         * x is the vectorized Choi-matrix to be fitted

        **PSD constraint**

        The PSD keyword constrains the fitted matrix to be
        postive-semidefinite. For the ``lstsq`` fitter method the fitted
        matrix is rescaled using the method proposed in Reference [1].
        For the ``cvx`` fitter method the convex constraint makes the
        optimization problem a SDP. If PSD=False the fitted matrix will still
        be constrained to be Hermitian, but not PSD. In this case the
        optimization problem becomes a SOCP.

        **Trace constraint**

        The trace keyword constrains the trace of the fitted matrix. If
        trace=None there will be no trace constraint on the fitted matrix.
        This constraint should not be used for process tomography and the
        trace preserving constraint should be used instead.

        **Trace preserving (TP) constraint**

        The trace_preserving keyword constrains the fitted matrix to be TP.
        This should only be used for process tomography, not state tomography.
        Note that the TP constraint implicitly enforces the trace of the fitted
        matrix to be equal to the square-root of the matrix dimension. If a
        trace constraint is also specified that differs from this value the fit
        will likely fail. Note that this can only be used for the CVX method.

        **CVXPY Solvers:**

        Various solvers can be called in CVXPY using the `solver` keyword
        argument. See the `CVXPY documentation
        <https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#solve-method-options>`_
        for more information on solvers.
