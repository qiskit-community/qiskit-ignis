        r"""Reconstruct a quantum state using CVXPY convex optimization.

        **Fitter method**

        The ``cvx`` fitter method used CVXPY convex optimization package.
        The ``lstsq`` method uses least-squares fitting (linear inversion).
        The ``auto`` method will use 'cvx' if the CVXPY package is found on
        the system, otherwise it will default to 'lstsq'.

        **Objective function**

        This fitter solves the constrained least-squares minimization:
        :math:`minimize: ||a * x - b ||_2`

        subject to:

         * :math:`x >> 0`
         * :math:`\text{trace}(x) = 1`

        where:

         * a is the matrix of measurement operators
           :math:`a[i] = \text{vec}(M_i).H`
         * b is the vector of expectation value data for each projector
           :math:`b[i] ~ \text{Tr}[M_i.H * x] = (a * x)[i]`
         * x is the vectorized density matrix to be fitted

        **PSD constraint**

        The PSD keyword constrains the fitted matrix to be
        postive-semidefinite. For the ``lstsq`` fitter method the fitted matrix
        is rescaled using the method proposed in Reference [1]. For the ``cvx``
        fitter method the convex constraint makes the optimization problem a
        SDP. If PSD=False the fitted matrix will still be constrained to be
        Hermitian, but not PSD. In this case the optimization problem becomes
        a SOCP.

        **Trace constraint**

        The trace keyword constrains the trace of the fitted matrix. If
        trace=None there will be no trace constraint on the fitted matrix.
        This constraint should not be used for process tomography and the
        trace preserving constraint should be used instead.

        **CVXPY Solvers:**

        Various solvers can be called in CVXPY using the `solver` keyword
        argument. See the `CVXPY documentation
        <https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#solve-method-options>`_
        for more information on solvers.
