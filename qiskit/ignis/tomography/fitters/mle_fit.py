        Objective function
        ------------------
        This fitter solves the least-squares minimization:

            minimize ||a * x - b ||_2

        where:
            a is the matrix of measurement operators a[i] = vec(M_i).H
            b is the vector of expectation value data for each projector
              b[i] ~ Tr[M_i.H * x] = (a * x)[i]
            x is the vectorized density matrix (or Choi-matrix) to be fitted

        PSD Constraint
        --------------
        Since this minimization problem is unconstrained the returned fitted
        matrix may not be postive semidefinite (PSD). To enforce the PSD
        constraint the fitted matrix is rescaled using the method proposed in
        Reference [1].

        Trace constraint
        ----------------
        In general the trace of the fitted matrix will be determined by the
        input data. If a trace constraint is specified the fitted matrix
        will be rescaled to have this trace by:
            rho = trace * rho / trace(rho)
