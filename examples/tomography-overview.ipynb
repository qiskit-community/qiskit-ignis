    "## The General Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of quantum tomography is to obtain data on quantum systems by performing several different measurements. In Qiskit Ignis we are currently concerened with the following two tomography tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantum state tomograhpy**: Given a quantum state described by a density operator $\\rho$, obtain a matrix representation for $\\rho$.\n",
    "2. **Quantum process tomograhpy**: Given a quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$, obtain a matrix representation (the **Choi matrix**) for $\\mathcal{E}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases we rely on the assumption that we have access to a large number of identical copies of the system and so can perform several different measures on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can roughly split the tomography process to three stages:\n",
    "1. Preperation: Add suitable initialization/measurement devices to the quantum system.\n",
    "2. Experiment: Obtain measurement data from the quantum system.\n",
    "3. Tomography: Use the obtained data to reconstruct the system's description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1 and 2 are related to the quantum system being studied, whereas step 3 is a classical computation which can be carried out on standard computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Tomography Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\rho$ be the density operator of a quantum state. If $\\rho$ can be reliably reproduced, it can be subjected to several measurements with respect to different operators; this data can be used to reconstruct $\\rho$ or a close approximation of it by several different methods.\n",

    "## Process Tomography Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum process describes the evolution of a quantum system over time. While many processes can be described as function taking a state and returning another state (e.g. unitary gates), in general a process can induce uncertainty (e.g. because a measurement was performed on because of noise). Because of that, processes are modeled as a function $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho)=\\rho^\\prime$ on the space of density operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process tomography aims to find a description of $\\mathcal{E}$ from a set of measurements. Like state tomography, we measure with respect to several different bases. Process tomography also uses several different initial states, as opposed to state tomography where only $\\left|0^n\\right\\rangle$ is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different representations for a quantum process: To name a few there is the **Kraus operators** representation, the **Superoperator** representation, the **Choi matrix** representation and the **$\\chi$ matrix** representation. In what follows we give explicit description for those representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Choi matrix representation has the advantage that its computation can be seen as a case of **state tomography** over a suitably chosen space. This enables us to use the same algorithms for both state and process tomography with only minor changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote by $X$ the state space. Usually in quantum computing it is a tensor product of 2-dimensional space spanned by $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$; here we only assume it is a complex vector space of dimension $n$. Only elements of norm 1 in $X$ are considered to represent quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space of all linear operators over $X$ is denoted by $L(X)$; every density operator is an element $\\rho \\in L(X)$ which is\n",
    "1. Of trace 1, i.e. $\\text{tr}(\\rho) = 1$\n",
    "2. Positive semidefinite, i.e. $\\left\\langle \\psi \\right|\\rho \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle \\ge 0$ for all $\\psi$. This is denoted by $\\rho \\ge 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space of all linear opeators over $L(X)$ is denoted by $T(X)$ (instead of using $L(L(X))$ which is more cubersome). A quantum process is an element of $T(X)$ mapping density operators to density operators. In order to do this, the process has to preserve the trace and positiveness of $\\rho$; we require it to be **trace-preserving** and **completely positive**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\mathcal{E}\\in T(X)$ is **trace-preserving** if $\\text{tr}(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho))=\\text{tr}(\\rho)$ for every $\\rho$.\n",
    "2. $\\mathcal{E}\\in T(X)$ is **positive** if $\\rho \\ge 0$ implies $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) \\ge 0$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{E}$ is **completely positive** if $\\text{Id}\\otimes \\mathcal{E}$ is positive where $\\text{Id}$ is the identity operator on any space of density operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kraus operators\n",
    "\n",
    "A common description of a quantum process $\\mathcal{E}$ is via **Kraus operators**. A set $\\left\\{K_1, K_2, \\dots, K_t\\right\\}$ such that $K_i \\in L(X)$ with the additional constraint that $\\sum_{i=1}^k K_i^\\dagger K_i = I$\n",
    "and the operation of $\\mathcal{E}$ is given by a sum of conjugations: \n",
    "$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=1}^k K_i\\rho K_i^\\dagger$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common description of quantum processes. In case of a unitary operator $U$, the set $\\left\\{U\\right\\}$ is a Kraus operator representation of it. Measurements and noises are also commonly given via Kraus operators. Note however that the Kraus representation of a quantum process is not unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Superoperator\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\mathcal{E}$ is a linear operator over $L(X)$ then for any choice of basis for $L(X)$ it can be described as a matrix $\\mathcal{S}$, such that $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\mathcal{S}\\cdot [\\rho]$ where $[\\rho]$ is the coordinate vector of $\\rho$ over the same basis. $\\mathcal{S}$ is called a **superoperator representation** of $\\mathcal{E}$; it is dependent on the choice of basis for $L(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice $\\rho$ is usually given by a matrix, and $[\\rho]$ is obtained by **vectorization** of $\\rho$; usually stacking the rows of $\\rho$ one after another (different stacking methods result in different superoperator representations).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choi matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a basis $\\left\\{\\left|0\\right\\rangle, \\left|1\\right\\rangle,\\dots, \\left|n-1\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$ of $X$, a basis for $L(X)$ consists of all the elements $\\left|i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle j\\right|$ for $0\\le i,j<n$. $\\mathcal{E}$ is completely determined by its operation on these basis elements; the Choi matrix collects the results of those operations. Formally, the Choi matrix is defined by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E} = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{n-1} \\left|i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle j\\right| \\otimes \\mathcal{E}(\\left|i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle j\\right|)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By representing $\\left|i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle j\\right|$ as a matrix with 1 in the $ij$ entry and 0 everywhere else, we get the following explicit matrix representation of the Choi matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E} = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "\\mathcal{E}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|\\right) & \\cdots & \\mathcal{E}\\left(\\left|0\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle n\\right|\\right)\\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{E}\\left(\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|\\right) & \\cdots & \\mathcal{E}\\left(\\left|1\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle n\\right|\\right)\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{E}\\left(\\left|n\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle 0\\right|\\right) & \\cdots & \\mathcal{E}\\left(\\left|n\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle n\\right|\\right)\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\chi$ matrix (process matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\chi$ matrix representation is similar to the Kraus representation since it also gives $\\mathcal{E}$ as a sum of operators acting on $\\rho$ from the left and right; however, in this case the set of operators is not specific to $\\mathcal{E}$ and can be any orthonormal basis for $L(X)$, and $\\mathcal{E}$ is represented by the coefficients of the operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, given a basis $\\left\\{\\sigma_0, \\dots \\sigma_{n^2-1}\\right\\}$ for $L(X)$, $\\mathcal{E}$ can be represented by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{n^2-1}\\chi_{ij}\\sigma_i\\rho\\sigma_j^\\dagger$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values $\\chi_{ij}$ are scalars uniquely determined by $\\mathcal{E}$ and the choice of basis. The $n^2 \\times n^2$ matrix $\\chi$ is called the $\\chi$ matrix of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process tomography with the Choi matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a quantum process $\\mathcal{E}$ with a Choi matrix $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}$, the evolution of a state $\\rho$ is \n",
    "$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_1\\left[(\\rho^t\\otimes\\mathbb{1})\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\text{Tr}_1$ denotes **partial trace**: $\\text{Tr}_1[A\\otimes B] = \\text{Tr}_1[A]B$ and $\\mathbb{1}$ is the identity operator on $X$. The above equation is obtained in a straightforward manners from the definitions and the fact that $(A\\otimes B)(C\\otimes D)=(AC)\\otimes(BD)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above equation it is possible to show that the act of measuring the outcome of $\\mathcal{E}$ on some initial $\\rho$ with some projector $P$ can be seen as the act of measuring $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}$ (when it is considered as a **state** in the space $L(X)$) with a measurement operator $\\overline{\\rho}\\otimes P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to the following algorithm for process tomography:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain a set of initial states $\\left\\{\\rho_1, \\dots \\rho_{k}\\right\\}$ and a set of projectors $\\left\\{P_1, \\dots P_{t}\\right\\}$ such that the set of all projectos $\\Pi_{i,j} = \\overline{\\rho_i}\\otimes P_j$ is tomographically complete for $L(X)$.\n",
    "2. Obtain measurements of $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}$ with $\\Pi_{i,j}$ by initializing a system to $\\rho_{i}$, applying $\\mathcal{E}$ (e.g. via a simulator or the quantum computer to check) and measuring via $P_j$.\n",
    "3. Pass the results and the description of $\\Pi_{i,j}$ to an algorithm for state tomography and obtain $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}$. "
