features:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.RepetitionCode` now has keyword arguments ``resets`` and ``delay``.
    The former determines whether reset gates are inserted after measurement.
    The latter allows a time (in dt) to be specificed for a delay after each
    measurement (and reset, if applicable).
    
    The :meth:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.RepitionCode.syndrome_measurement` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.RepetitionCode` now has keyword
    arguments ``final`` and ``delay``. The former determines whether to add reset gates according
    to the global ``resets``, or to overwrite it with appropriate behavior for the
    final round of syndrome measurements. The latter allows a time (in dt) to be specificed 
    for a delay after each measurement (and reset, if applicable).
upgrade:
  - |
    The keyword argument `reset` has been removed for the
     :meth:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.RepitionCode.syndrome_measurement` method of
    :class:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.RepetitionCode`. This is replaced by the global
    ``resets``
    keyword argument for the class as well as the keyword argument ``final`` for
    ``syndrome_measurement``. In cases where one would previously add the final
    measurement round using ``reset=False`` to avoid the final reset gates, one
    should now use ``final=True``.
