features:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.RepetitionCode` now has keyword arguments ``resets`` and ``delay``.
    The former determines whether reset gates are inserted after measurement.
    The latter allows a time (in dt) to be specificed for a delay after each
    measurement (and reset, if applicable).
upgrade:
  - |
    The keyword argument `reset` has been removed for the `syndrome_measurement`
    method of :class: `RepetitionCode`. This is replaced by the global `resets`
    keyword argument for the class.
