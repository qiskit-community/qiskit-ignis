features:
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.randomized_benchmarking_seq`
    function was refactored to use the updated Clifford class :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford`,
    to allow efficient Randomized Benchmarking (RB) on Clifford sequences with more than 2 qubits.
    In addition, the code of the CNOT-Dihedral class
    :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.CNOTDihedral`
    was refactored to make it more efficient, by using numpy arrays, as well not using pre-generated
    pickle files storing all the 2-qubit group elements.
    The :func:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.randomized_benchmarking_seq`
    function has a new kwarg ``rand_seed`` which can be used to specify a seed for the random number
    generator used to generate the RB circuits. This can be useful for having a reproducible circuit.
deprecations:
  - |
    The kwarg ``interleaved_gates`` for the
    :func:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.randomized_benchmarking_seq`
    function has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    It is superseded by ``interleaved_elem``.
    The helper functions :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.BasicUtils`,
    :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.CliffordUtils` and
    :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.DihedralUtils` were deprecated.
    These classes are superseded by :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.RBgroup`
    that handles the group operations needed for RB.
    The class :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.Clifford`
    is superseded by :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford`.
upgrade:
  - |
    The :func:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.randomized_benchmarking_seq`
    function is now using the updated Clifford class :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford`
    and the updated CNOT-Dihedral class :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.CNOTDihedral`
    to construct its output instead of using pre-generated group tables for the Clifford and CNOT-Dihedral
    group elements, which were stored in pickle files.
    This may result in subtle differences from the output from the previous version.
