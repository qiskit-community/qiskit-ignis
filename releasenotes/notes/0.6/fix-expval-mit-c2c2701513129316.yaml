    Fixed an issue in the expectation value method
    :meth:`~qiskit.ignis.mitigation.TensoredExpvalMeasMitigator.expectation_value`,
    for the error mitigation classes
    :class:`~qiskit.ignis.mitigation.TensoredExpvalMeasMitigator` and
    :class:`~qiskit.ignis.mitigation.CTMPExpvalMeasMitigator` if the
    ``qubits`` kwarg was not specified it would incorrectly use the
    total number of qubits of the mitigator, rather than the number of
    classical bits in the count dictionary leading to greatly reduced
    performance.
    Fixed `#561 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis/issues/561>`__
