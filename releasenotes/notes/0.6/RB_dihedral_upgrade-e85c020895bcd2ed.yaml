    The :func:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.randomized_benchmarking_seq`
    function is now using the upgraded CNOTDihedral class
    :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.CNOTDihedral`
    to allow CNOT-Dihedral Randomized Benchmarking on more than two qubits.
