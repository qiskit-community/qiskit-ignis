    The :func:`qiskit.ignis.mitigation.expval_meas_mitigator_circuits` function
    has been improved so that the number of circuits generated by the function
    used for calibration by the CTMP method are reduced from :math:`O(n)` to
    :math:`O(\log{n})` (where :math:`n` is the number of qubits).
