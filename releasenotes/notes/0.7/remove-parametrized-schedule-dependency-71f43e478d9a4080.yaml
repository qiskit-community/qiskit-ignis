    Remove ``ParametrizedSchedule`` from
    :py:func:`~qiskit.ignis.characterization.calibrations.ibmq_utils.update_u_gates`.

    ``ParametrizedSchedule`` was deprecated as a part of Qiskit-terra 0.17.0 and will be
    removed in next release. The function now updates u gates with ``Schedule`` programs
    involving unassigned ``Parameter`` objects.
