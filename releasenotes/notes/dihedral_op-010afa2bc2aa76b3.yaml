    The :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.CNOTDihedral`
    now contains the following new features.
    Initialization from various types of objects:
    `CNOTDihedral`, `ScalarOp`, `QuantumCircuit`, `Instruction` and `Pauli`.
    Converting to a matrix using `to_matrix` and to an operator using `to_operator`.
    Tensor product methods `tensor` and `expand`.
    Calculation of the adjoint, conjugate and transpose using `conjugate`, `adjoint`
    and `transpose` methods.
    Verify that an element is CNOTDihedral using `is_cnotdihedral` method.
    General decomposition of a CNOTDihedral element into a circuit method `to_circuit`
    was extended to allow any number of qubits, based on the function
    `decompose_cnotdihedral_general`.

    Fixing a bug in the class
    :class:`qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking.CNOTDihedral`
    for elements with more than 5 quits.
