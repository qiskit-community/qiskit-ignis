    The :meth:`qiskit.ignis.verification.quantum_volume.QVFitter.plot_qv_trial` method
    has been added to plot individual trials, leveraging on the
    :meth:`qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram` method from Qiskit Terra.
    Bitstring counts are plotted as overlapping histograms for ideal (hollow) and experimental
    (filled) values.
    Experimental heavy output probability are shown on the legend.
    Median probability is plotted as red dashed line.
