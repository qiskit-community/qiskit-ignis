    Fix the ``"auto"`` method of the
    :class:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.tomography.TomographyFitter`,
    :class:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.tomography.StateTomographyFitter`, and
    :class:`~qiskit.ignis.verification.tomography.ProcessTomographyFitter` to
    only use ``"cvx"`` if CVXPY is installed *and* a third-party SDP solver
    other than SCS is available. This is because the SCS solver has lower
    accuracy than other solver methods and often returns a density matrix or
    Choi-matrix that is not completely-positive and fails validation when used
    with the :func:`qiskit.quantum_info.state_fidelity` or
    :func:`qiskit.quantum_info.process_fidelity` functions.
